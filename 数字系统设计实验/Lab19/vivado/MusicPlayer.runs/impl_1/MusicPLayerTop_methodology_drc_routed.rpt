XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
